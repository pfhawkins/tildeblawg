I was delighted to notice on twitter that https://twitter.com/insom[@insom] has created http://tilde.website[tilde.website]. Visit that URL, and you shall be taken to a random tilde user's page.

This reminded me that it has been an inexcusably long time since I updated the http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/othertildes.html[other tildes list]. I'm in the process of poring through the list and diving into old emails to get it back into fighting shape. Sadly, at least a third of the tildes on the list are no longer active. It's not surprising; actually, it's heartening that so many tildes are still active almost two years later.
