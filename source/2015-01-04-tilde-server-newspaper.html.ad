http://tilde.club/\~brennen[~brennen], the operator over at http://squiggle.city[Squiggle City], added publisher to his list of titles as he brought forth http://squiggle.city/~paper/archives/squiggle.city.herald.1.1.txt[the first edition of]  http://squiggle.city/~paper/[the Squiggle City Herald]. The Squiggle City Herald is an entirely ascii endeavor. In lieu of an advice column, it has a page devoted to “SHELL COMMAND OF THE WEEK”.

Over in the shared #tildeclub IRC channel, http://squiggle.city/\~brennen[~brennen] crowdsourced a name for the Squiggle City paper of record. Suggestions included:

* THE SQUIGGLE CITIZEN
* THE SQUIGGLE DOT CITY ADVOCATE
* SQUIGGLE CITY HERALD
* Christian Science Squiggle
* the squiggle daily worker
* squiggle city international post herald tribune inquirer excelsior today times journal

It remains to be seen whether http://protocol.club/\~brennen/[~brennen] will routinely change the name of the paper, or set up several feuding papers in an apparent oligopoly.
